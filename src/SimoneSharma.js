      <h1 style={headingStyle}>1. What inspired you to start Youth Grow Youth?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> I started YGY in 2021 and I gained the spark during my college application process. It was overwhelming and scary, and I was lost. That was the time I realized that there will be so many students like me who will be facing the same challenge. I come from a CBSE background where we are taught that if you want to become the next person to get into Harvard, Stanford, MIT, or Yale, all you need are good grades, but nobody is out here talking about the importance of extracurricular. That is when I felt a very strong urge to create a platform that not only provides access to opportunities but also a supportive community of students for guidance.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>2. Could you share how YGY got the opportunity to get backed by Harvard and even got involved with Stanford University?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> A journey with Harvard started when they recognized YGY’s unique approach to enhance education opportunities globally. A commitment to help students also resonated with Harvard’s startup and nonprofit accelerator, which ideally aims to empower young changemakers across the globe. We got amazing support and tons of resources, partnerships, mentorships, and global recognition.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>3. What are the challenges you faced during your journey?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> For me, it was not knowing the starting point. I started with a vague idea in my mind and I was not even sure about my idea and was seeking validation. But the main thing was deep down in my heart, I really wanted to make it happen, and I did. Believing in yourself, taking that actual step toward your idea is a huge thing.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>4. Looking back on your journey, what is the one piece of advice you would give to yourself when you were just starting out?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> If I knew that it was completely fine to ask for help, I would have been on cloud nine. It got really exhausting sometimes because I was taking care of everything by myself, whether it be newsletters, partnerships, or content. Over time I realized that having a team to rely on is incredibly important.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>5. What are your aspirations for yourself and YGY in the upcoming years?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> For YGY, I have many plans and ideas breaking it down. I have envisioned reaching even more students globally, I aim to build on sustainable partnerships. I’m stepping out for university, so I definitely want to take my startup there for further growth and to make it more globally accessible. Personally, I want to continue learning and growing and observing people that I am up to both as a leader and an advocate for social change. I hope to inspire more people to believe in their potential.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>6. What advice would you like to give to young entrepreneurs and leaders as they embark on their initiatives?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> Firstly, trust your idea and its potential to actually make a difference. I struggled with it, you don’t have to, believe that it will go far and will climb enormous heights. Secondly, set yourself out with a team that has the same vision and motive. Being surrounded by a team that wants to be a part of your mission can also bring a spectrum of perspectives.
