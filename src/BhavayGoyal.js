      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        In the realm of competitive programming, Bhavay Goyal, a 12th-grade student, has emerged as a remarkable talent. His selection for the esteemed Indian National Olympiad of Informatics' Training Camp, which gathers the top 30 programming enthusiasts from across India, showcases his exceptional abilities. In this exclusive interview, Bhavay provides insights into his journey, motivations, and aspirations, shedding light on the challenges and rewards of competitive programming.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Q1. How and when did you discover your passion for programming?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans. A:</strong> From a young age, I had a very keen interest in technology and the inner working of software. This curiosity drove me to explore programming and unravel the secrets behind creating apps and writing codes. My mother, a computer science lecturer herself, guided me throughout the time and helped me flourish my interest in the field, paving the spectacular path for the future.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Q2. In India, it is traditional to think of JEE when you think about pursuing a career in engineering, what are your thoughts over this?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans. A:</strong> Since I had decided to pursue computer science since an early age, it had totally diverged me from the conventional path of JEE. While many parents do stress upon the fact that pursuing JEE is important, my parents were too supportive of my decision to choose this field. Though in the start, I was balancing programming as a hobby along with my JEE preparations, but after I discovered about the Informatics Olympiad and the potential of college applications through Olympiad achievements, I shifted my focus solely on competitive programming.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Q3. How did you balance your school commitments, hobbies, and studies along with programming all at the same time?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans. A:</strong> I, not unlike the other peers of my age, struggled initially with time management more than everything. Initially, I tended to prioritize programming over my studies as it was what I really liked to do, resulting in mixed results in my school exams. But as I progressed, I learned effective time management skills which helped me to allocate exclusive time for intensive Olympiad preparations while also keeping up with my schoolwork and other things.
        <br /><br />
        This adaptability and determination showcased Bhavay's ability to strike a balance between his passions and academic responsibilities.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Q4. What have you thought about the future, like any specific colleges or something?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans. A:</strong> Well, to be specific, I have thought of IIIT Hyderabad and IIT Gandhinagar as of now as they are widely known for their excellence in the computer science field, providing the ideal conditions I need.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Q5. Could you elaborate more about your journey to the National Informatics Olympiad?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans. A:</strong> The selection process takes place in many stages like zonal, national, and training camp levels. In the national round, only 30 students across India are selected for the training camp; further from there, only 4 get selected to represent India at the international stage. The whole selection and training process takes place just like any other Olympiad, demonstrating the importance of this particular subject compared to the other mainstream subjects like math or science.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Q6. What Tips and advice would you give for the beginners and people who have aspirations in the computer science field?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans. A:</strong> For anyone who aspires for a career in the CS field, I would advise them to start with any programming language and then gradually delve into the basics of competitive programming through online resources and tutorials. Some platforms I can recommend are USACO, which provides a strong foundation for Informatics Olympiad preparation. Along with it, CP Algorithms is also an excellent resource for learning data structures and algorithms. Competitive Programming by Luv, a Youtube Playlist I found helpful in my initial days might come in handy as well.
