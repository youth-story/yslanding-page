      <h1 style={headingStyle}>1. What was the defining moment or experience that inspired you to embark on this journey?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> This incident drastically changed me and I talk about this wherever I go, during the pandemic our house maid got periods while she was working in our home and she was very uncomfortable asking about sanitary pads and I overheard this conversation between her and my mother and I said we’re the educated urban people and we can’t put forward stigmas like this and that’s what led me to open an organization 'break the ice' and ultimately become an entrepreneur. Before this moment I was a very big introvert, and I think it was this moment that shaped me as a person who I am today.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>2. You’re the CEO of ‘break the ice’ organization. Could you elaborate what the organization is about.</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> Break the Ice is all about breaking taboos among young people which they are not aware of. The taboos that we work on are mental health, menstruation, gender equality, climate change, etc. We have realized that even if there are conversations that are being started in a few places, there are still people who don’t have access to the right information. So we’re working with young people across 10 countries and are understanding what are the stigmas that you’re ignoring and what are the things you need to have awareness around.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>3. Were there moments when you felt torn out between textbooks and your larger mission? How did you navigate through these crossroads?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> In terms of managing your time, 'HAVE YOUR PRIORITIES SET'. What I usually do is I have a weekly priority list and I stick to them 100%, so if you’re looking to manage time better, what you can really do is manage your week well, and that’s what I try to do. If I have my assignments pending or any event which I have to organize, I make sure to create a to-do list, and I follow it in order to prioritize my time well.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>4. Have you tapped into volunteering and internships? If yes, how have they helped you?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> I’ve done lots of volunteering and internships. One thing I would like to highlight is if you know in which field your interest lies, make sure you do fellowships as it’s the best way to learn about a particular field. If you volunteer, you will get your hands on working skills, whereas through fellowships, you will learn from the experts and understand what you want to learn more about to the core. Do a few fellowships and then venture into volunteering and internships; that’s how you will gain the most out of it. I’ve also tried to do the same and learned so much from it.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>5. What advice would you give to your past self?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> 'You need to step out of your comfort zone,' if I had a time machine and I could go back in time, that’s what I would say to myself because back then I used to overthink a lot, and I’ve had that quote all over the walls of my room that your growth happens only when you step out of your comfort zone, but I never took it seriously, and if I were to advise my old self, I would say step out of your comfort zone, it’s okay, you will fall and get over it.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>6. What are the resources that helped you with your goal?</h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Ans.:</strong> Firstly, I would say LinkedIn is a resource hub and trustably powerful. Secondly, I'll say YouTube, only if you’re able to go to the right channels, it is very valuable but it also has its cons, it might turn into a binge-watching platform as well, which is totally fine, but keep it in mind that you are there to educate yourself; moreover, watch at least one educational video on YouTube every day.
