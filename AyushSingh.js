      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        Ayush Singh is a remarkable individual whose coding journey began during the COVID-19 lockdown. Driven by a dual passion for programming and a desire to support his family, Ayush delved into the world of code, overcoming challenges and turning them into stepping stones toward success in both programming and entrepreneurship.

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Quotation</h1>
      <p style={quotationStyle}>"It’s never a short-cut, it’s always the amount of hard-work you put in."</p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>When were you introduced to the programming industry and what did you like about it which made you pursue it at a very young age?</h1>
      <p>
        The doors to the programming world opened for me during the time of the COVID-19 lockdown. Witnessing my family's financial struggles, I felt responsible to contribute in any way I could. This led me on a journey to explore diverse career avenues, ultimately giving way for my fascination with programming. My inclination towards programming was driven by a dual motive. Firstly, I had a strong desire to get over my family's financial burdens. Secondly, the prospect of achieving financial independence at a young age helped in the aspirations I had.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Why did you choose Data Science which is one of the toughest domains in Programming?</h1>
      <p>
        Among the plethora of programming domains, the realm of Data Science caught my attention. While conventional web development seemed a common path, I yearned for a challenge that would push my boundaries and since I already knew what I was doing, and it was my personal wish to choose the most difficult way, I was ready for the challenges.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>How difficult it was for you to crack your first company? You would have faced a lot of difficulties due to lack of experience and even because you are a teenager.</h1>
      <p>
        The journey to securing my first job was laden with obstacles due to my limited experience. Nevertheless, I worked on my core skills and fundamentals, determined to break barriers. Developing my resume in the way that would meet the expectations of potential employers also played a pivotal role.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>You run two start-ups. One of them is Antern. What is Antern and with what motive you started it?</h1>
      <p>
        Antern is not just as a start-up, but as a revolutionary initiative, Antern provides affordable Data Science education. It gives practical wisdom to young minds, enabling them to apply theoretical knowledge effectively. The impact of Antern's CS101 courses have helped over 2000 students who've navigated towards job success and dream positions.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>Now coming to your second start-up which you recently joined. What is Second Brain Labs? What made you join Shubham with him in his journey?</h1>
      <p>
        The alliance with Shubham Kumar, the mastermind behind Second Brain Labs helped me a lot. A co-founder's role in this venture came into play as I needed the concept of connecting business founders directly with their users. Second Brain Labs pioneers the use of AI models to facilitate complex conversations between founders and users, facilitating the gathering of invaluable feedback for organizational enhancement.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>How would you suggest a beginner to start his coding journey? What would be the resources you would suggest him for the very basics of Programming?</h1>
      <p>
        To aspiring newbies, my advice is to embark with Python, anchoring themselves to programming fundamentals. While YouTube provides valuable resources, textbooks serve as sturdy companions in this educational journey. I emphasize cautious navigation of online educators' content, utilizing their lectures for reference rather than sole reliance. The pursuit of programming should be marked by appropriate time investments, along with shortcuts that promise speedy mastery.
      </p>

      <h1 style={headingStyle}>What were the biggest mistakes you did in your coding journey? How you would have corrected them now?</h1>
      <p>
        My journey was not without hiccups. The involvement of personal relationships during my learning phase proved the most destructive. I encourage aspiring learners to remain committed and focused. My own trough, lasting several months during the learning curve, taught me the necessity of enduring these inevitable phases. Beyond such lows, the ascent to exponential growth awaits, a lesson I wish I'd learned earlier.
